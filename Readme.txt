#**Bacterial haplotype reconstruction**#

AUTHORS: Patricia MorÃ¡n Losada (MoranLosada.Patricia@mh-hannover.de)

##**Description**##

This approach identifies bacterial haplotypes which are defined as the length of syntenic segments with identical SNPs in a pairwise comparisons of bacterial genomes. The metric is invariant regarding the reference genome chosen. Two matrices were constructed that contained columns of all quality-controlled SNPs ordered by genome position of the reference and rows of the bacterial isolates of interest. SNP syntenies were extracted from pairwise comparisons allowing the identification of similarity between taxa. The outcome is the distribution of the length of haplotypes in the analyzed strain sample that can be exploited to visualize the relatedness of clades in a tree. 

##**Usage**##

To run the scripts Perl and R must be installed.

The folder Bacterial_haplotype_reconstruction.tar.gz contains two subfolders. The subfolder 'Scripts' contains four perl scripts and two R scripts to run the pipeline. The subfolder 'Examples' contains 5 different files in the 'Data' folder and output files in the 'Results' folder. 

1. 1_haplotypes_identification.pl : this script identifies all different haplotypes 
 
		INPUT: .txt file with all SNPs 
		INPUT FORMAT: Strain name\tSNP position\tNucleotide reference\t Nucleotide strain (the last 2 columns are optional)

		USAGE : perl 1_haplotypes_identification.pl
		
		OUTPUT: the script generates the following files:
			a)Haplotype_distances_hp.txt -> this file contains all different haplotypes for each pariwise comparison.
					1st column: id value of the haplotype
					2nd column: value of syntenic SNPs
					3rd column: haplotype start position (based on the syntenic SNP position)
					4th column: haplotype end position (based on the syntenic SNP position)
					5th column: pair comparison names
					6th column: haplotype start position (based on the reference position)
					7th column: haplotype end position (based on the reference position)
					8th column: pair comparison names
			
			b)TOTAL_MATRIX.txt -> it contains a matrix with all haplotypes for each pair comparison based on syntenic SNPs
					1st row: SNP position in the reference genome
					2nd row: number of SNP
					3rd row and following: number of syntenic SNPs at each position for each comparison.

2. 2_matrix_rank_numbers_tree.pl : this script calculates the sum and median value of the haplotype rank numbers and generate two matrices.
			
		INPUT: Haplotype_distances_hp.txt, strains.txt and unique_consecutive_snps_sorted.txt (generated in 1_haplotypes_identification.pl)
		
		USAGE: perl 2_matrix_rank_numbers_tree.pl

		OUTPUT: a new folder called 2_output_files is created which contains:
			a) Genome_distances_hp_rank_numbers.txt ->it contains the information of all haplotypes plus an aditional column which contains
				the rank number value based on the syntenic SNPs value.
			b) matrix_median_ranks.txt -> it contains a matrix with the median rank number value for each pair comparison
			c) matrix_sum_ranks.txt -> it contains a matrix with the sum of rank numbers for each pair comparison

3. 3_similarity.pl: this script calculates the percentage of syntenic SNPs shared by two strains.
		
		INPUT: Haplotype_distances_hp.txt and TOTAL_MATRIX.txt (generated in 1_haplotypes_identification.pl)
		
		USAGE : perl 3_similarity

		OUTPUT: a new folder called 3_output_files is created which contains:
			a) sum_snps_shared.txt -> it contains the sum of syntenic SNPs shared by a pair comparison
			b) matrix_similarities.txt -> it contains the percentages of syntenic SNPs shared by two strains
			c) Similarity_strains.pdf -> plot to visualize the different percentages values 

4. 4_Hb_distribution_plot.pl : the script plots the distribution of haplotypes along the reference genome.
	
		INPUT: Haplotype_distances_hp.txt (generated in 1_haplotypes_identification.pl)

		USAGE: perl 4_Hb_distribution_plot.pl

		OUTPUT: a new folder called 4_output_files is created which contains:
			a) Distribution_blocks_total.txt -> it contains the start and end reference genome position of each haplotype
			b) Distribution_blocks_total.pdf -> a plot of the haplotypes distribution along the reference genome.
